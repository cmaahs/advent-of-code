Fun with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

Since the challenge is to come up with a solution quickly, the code written here
is pretty raw.  And fun to compare with what quick solutions others came up with
under pressure.  I find this very similar to Ops type gigs where you might be
live troubleshooting production issues, and on the fly writing tools to help
collect data or to fix issues.

Around Day 3 is where I was made aware of the Advent Of Code site.  And of
course, I'm hooked :)

My general code layout and run methodology:

`go run main.go {p1|p2} ./{filename}.txt`

Where `p1` and `p2` represent part one and part two code paths respectively.

### Solved

## 2015

I've been going back and working on some of the old ones.
