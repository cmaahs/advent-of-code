# Notes

I don't know if it was starting really early in the morning, or what my brain
was thinking.  My COL/ROW, X/Y coordinate variable names ended up being
horrible.  Once I started outputting the GRID it became apparent that I had
named things in a bit of a horrible way.  And since this is a speed thing, I
did not go back and fix it, and clearly never will... You've been warned...
Read at your own risk...
